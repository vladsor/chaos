Please note that autochaos is only required if you want to modify the
build process; for example, adding new files, removing files,
etcetera. Thus, many people will not need it. Of course, having it

It can all be found at CPAN (http://www.cpan.org), the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network. For more information about this, see the above
mentioned URL.
