autochaos is a build system, designed with one single purpose: To
easify compilation of the chaos system, and programs for this
system. The reason we started thinking about doing this was we felt
GNU autoconf/automake didn't really fit our purpose very well. It was
slow (lots of redundant checks), and added lots of bloat. Most of our
packages was just a few K in actual size, but the added size of the
autoconf/automake stuff was about 140K each! We felt this was not how
we wanted things. Thus, the idea of autochaos was born. It has those
simple features:

  * XML configuration (used to know how to build the configure
    script). The same configuration file will soon be used by the
    package building system.

  * Built for chaos from the ground up. I.e., no need to override
    paths, work around gazillions of buggy stone-age systems, and so
    on.

  * Much greater speed and less size. autochaos is being built on Perl
    (with some extra modules which are readily available through CPAN)
    instead of m4/sed/shell/etc. Yes, you can definitely feel the
    difference. This is not at all strange -- autoconf/automake is
    designed to be as portable as possible, at the cost of
    speed. autochaos is not.

  * Helps you follow the chaos Coding Standards. All makefiles
    generated by autochaos follows our conventions regarding C
    compiler flags etcetera.

As you might have understood by now, autochaos is probably only
suitable for compiling programs for chaos. If you are interested in
extending the program to support multi-platform programs, please
contact me and I think we can work something out.
