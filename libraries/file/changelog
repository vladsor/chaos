	* file.c (file_init): Changed the timeout of the
	ipc_service_resolve call, since it is no longer needed with the
	process parent unblocking.

	* file.c: Fixed an american typo.

	* file.c (file_open): Fixed some of the semantics; a program who
	wants to open a file shouldn't have to build up a data
	structure. Thus, everything needed is now passed as arguments
	instead.
	(file_read): Likewise.
