the kernel stuff, etc.

chaos 0.0.5
-----------

  * Check out that everything works (more or less).

Further away (chaos 0.1.0, ...)
-------------------------------

  * Create an installation program.
  * ISO9660 support.
  * ATAPI.
  * Implement support for writing files in the FAT and VFS servers.
  * Extend autochaos and merge with cAPS, so package building can be
    done.
  * Finish the ISO/POSIX libraries, for easy start-up porting of GNU
    applications.
  * Port Perl to chaos, so autochaos can be run natively.  
  * Create tornado.
  * Start porting some more file systems. (ext2, UFS, NFS, maybe more?)
  * Networking for processes. (listening and sending from/to sockets)
