 * @brief               Exceptions are classified as faults, traps, or aborts 
 *                      depending on the way they are reported and whether the 
 *                      instruction that caused the exception can be restarted
 *                      with no loss of program or task continuity.

/**
 * @brief               A fault is an exception that can generally be corrected
 *                      and that, once corrected, allows the program to be 
 *                      restarted with no loss of continuity. 
 *
 * When a fault is reported, the processor restores the machine state to the 
 * state prior to the beginning of execution of the faulting instruction.
 * The return address (saved contents of the CS and EIP registers) for the
 * fault handler points to the faulting instruction, rather than the
 * instruction following the faulting instruction.
 *
 * @note  There are a small subset of exceptions that are normally reported 
 * as faults, but under architectural corner cases, they are not restartable
 * and some processor context will be lost. An example of these cases is the
 * execution of the POPAD instruction where the stack frame crosses over the
 * end of the stack segment. The exception handler will see that the CS:EIP has
 * been restored as if the POPAD instruction had not executed however internal
 * processor state (general purpose registers) will have been modified. These
 * corner cases are INTERRUPT AND EXCEPTION HANDLING considered programming
 * errors and an application causeing this class of exceptions will likely be
 * terminated by the operating system.

 * @brief               <H3>Interrupt 3—Breakpoint Exception (#BP)</H3>
 *
 * @par                 Exception Class
 * Trap.
 *
 * @par                 Description
 * Indicates that a breakpoint instruction (INT 3) was executed, causing a
 * breakpoint trap to be generated. Typically, a debugger sets a breakpoint by
 * replacing the first opcode byte of an instruction with the opcode for the
 * INT 3 instruction. (The INT 3 instruction is one byte long, which makes it
 * easy to replace an opcode in a code segment in RAM with the breakpoint
 * opcode.) The operating system or a debugging tool can use a data segment
 * mapped to the same physical address space as the code segment to place an
 * INT 3 instruction in places where it is desired to call the debugger. With
 * the P6 family, Pentium®, Intel486™, and Intel386™ processors, it is
 * more convenient to set breakpoints with the debug registers. (Refer to
 * Section 15.3.2., “Breakpoint Exception (#BP)—Interrupt Vector 3”, in
 * Chapter 15, <I>Debugging and Performance Monitoring</I>, for information
 * about the breakpoint exception.) If more breakpoints are needed beyond what
 * the debug registers allow, the INT 3 instruction can be used. The breakpoint
 * (#BP) exception can also be generated by executing the INT n instruction
 * with an operand of 3. The action of this instruction (INT 3) is slightly
 * different than that of the INT 3 instruction (refer to “INTn/INTO/INT3—Call
 * to Interrupt Procedure” in Chapter 3 of the Intel Architecture Software
 * Developer’s Manual, Volume 2).

 * Saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the instruction following
 * the INT 3 instruction.
 *
 * @par                 Program State Change
 * Even though the EIP points to the instruction following the breakpoint
 * instruction, the state of the program is essentially unchanged because the
 * INT 3 instruction does not affect any register or memory locations. The
 * debugger can thus resume the suspended program by replacing the INT 3
 * instruction that caused the breakpoint with the original opcode and
 * decrementing the saved contents of the EIP register. Upon returning from the
 * debugger, program execution resumes with the replaced instruction.

 * respectively. When performing arithmetic on signed operands, the OF flag can

 * the INTO instruction is that if the overflow exception is detected, an

 * condition.

 * This exception can generated either in the context of the original task or

 * Chapter 6, Task Management). Until the processor has completely verified the
 * presence of the new TSS, the exception is generated in the context of the
 * original task. Once the existence of the new TSS is verified, the task
 * switch is considered complete. Any invalid-TSS conditions detected after
 * this point are handled in the context of the new task. (A task switch is
 * considered complete when the task register is loaded with the segment
 * selector for the new TSS and, if the switch is due to a procedure call or
 * interrupt, the previous task link field of the new TSS references the old
 * TSS.)<BR>
 * To insure that a valid TSS is available to process the exception, the
 * invalid-TSS exception handler must be a task called using a task gate.
 *
 * @par                 Exception Error Code
 * An error code containing the segment selector index for the segment
 * descriptor that caused the violation is pushed onto the stack of the
 * exception handler. If the EXT flag is set, it indicates that the exception
 * was caused by an event external to the currently running program (for
 * example, if an external interrupt handler using a task gate attempted a task
 * switch to an invalid TSS).
 *
 * @par                 Saved Instruction Pointer
 * If the exception condition was detected before the task switch was carried
 * out, the saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the instruction
 * that invoked the task switch. If the exception condition was detected after
 * the task switch was carried out, the saved contents of CS and EIP registers
 * point to the first instruction of the new task.
 *
 * @par                 Program State Change
 * The ability of the invalid-TSS handler to recover from the fault depends on
 * the error condition than causes the fault. Refer to Section 6.3., “Task
 * Switching” in Chapter 6, Task Management for more information on the task
 * switch process and the possible recovery actions that can be taken.<BR>
 * If an invalid TSS exception occurs during a task switch, it can occur before
 * or after the commit-to-new-task point. If it occurs before the commit point,
 * no program state change occurs. If it occurs after the commit point (when
 * the segment descriptor information for the new segment selectors have been
 * loaded in the segment registers), the processor will load all the state
 * information from the new TSS before it generates the exception. During a
 * task switch, the processor first loads all the segment registers with
 * segment selectors from the TSS, then checks their contents for validity. If
 * an invalid TSS exception is discovered, the remaining segment registers are
 * loaded but not checked for validity and therefore may not be usable for
 * referencing memory. The invalid TSS handler should not rely on being able to
 * use the segment selectors found in the CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers
 * without causing another exception. The exception handler should load all
 * segment registers before trying to resume the new task; otherwise,
 * general-protection exceptions (#GP) may result later under conditions that
 * make diagnosis more difficult. The Intel recommended way of dealing
 * situation is to use a task for the invalid TSS exception handler. The task
 * switch back to the interrupted task from the invalid-TSS exceptionhandler
 * task will then cause the processor to check the registers as it loads them
 * from the TSS.

 *     </LI>
 * </UL>
 * An operating system typically uses the segment-not-present exception to
 * implement virtual memory at the segment level. If the exception handler
 * loads the segment and returns, the interrupted program or task resumes
 * execution.<BR>
 * A not-present indication in a gate descriptor, however, does not indicate
 * that a segment is not present (because gates do not correspond to segments).
 * The operating system may use the present flag for gate descriptors to
 * trigger exceptions of special significance to the operating system.
 *
 * @par                 Exception Error Code
 * An error code containing the segment selector index for the segment
 * descriptor that caused the violation is pushed onto the stack of the
 * exception handler. If the EXT flag is set, it indicates that the exception
 * resulted from an external event (NMI or INTR) that caused an interrupt,
 * which subsequently referenced a not-present segment. The IDT flag is set if
 * the error code refers to an IDT entry (e.g., an INT instruction referencing
 * a not-present gate).
 *
 * @par                 Saved Instruction Pointer
 * The saved contents of CS and EIP registers normally point to the instruction
 * that generated the exception. If the exception occurred while loading
 * segment descriptors for the segment selectors in a new TSS, the CS and EIP
 * registers point to the first instruction in the new task. If the exception
 * occurred while accessing a gate descriptor, the CS and EIP registers point
 * to the instruction that invoked the access (for example a CALL instruction
 * that references a call gate).
 *
 * @par                 Program State Change
 * If the segment-not-present exception occurs as the result of loading a
 * register (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS, or LDTR), a program-state change does
 * accompany the exception, because the register is not loaded. Recovery from
 * this exception is possible by simply loading the missing segment into memory
 * and setting the present flag in the segment descriptor.<BR> 
 * If the segment-not-present exception occurs while accessing a gate
 * descriptor, a program-state change does not accompany the exception.
 * Recovery from this exception is possible merely by setting the present flag

 * If a segment-not-present exception occurs during a task switch, it can occur
 * before or after the commit-to-new-task point (refer to Section 6.3., “Task
 * Switching” in Chapter 6, Task Management). If it occurs before the commit
 * point, no program state change occurs. If it occurs after the commit point,
 * the processor will load all the state information from the new TSS (without

 * generates the exception. The segment-not-present exception handler should
 * thus not rely on being able to use the segment selectors found in the CS,

 *         implicitly or explicitly use the SS register (for example, MOV AX,

 * generates the exception. The general-protection exception handler should
 * thus not rely on being able to use the segment selectors found in the CS,

/**
 * @brief               <H3>Interrupt 14—Page-Fault Exception (#PF)</H3>
 *
 * @par                 Exception Class
 * Fault.
 *
 * @par                 Description
 * Indicates that, with paging enabled (the PG flag in the CR0 register is
 * set), the processor detected one of the following conditions while using the
 * page-translation mechanism to translate a linear address to a physical
 * address:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>
 *         The P (present) flag in a page-directory or page-table entry needed for the address
 *         translation is clear, indicating that a page table or the page containing the operand is not
 *         present in physical memory.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         The procedure does not have sufficient privilege to access the indicated page (that is, a
 *         procedure running in user mode attempts to access a supervisor-mode page).
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         Code running in user mode attempts to write to a read-only page. In the Intel486™ and
 *         later processors, if the WP flag is set in CR0, the page fault will also be triggered by code
 *         running in supervisor mode that tries to write to a read-only user-mode page.
 *     </LI>
 * </UL>
 * The exception handler can recover from page-not-present conditions and
 * restart the program or task without any loss of program continuity. It can
 * also restart the program or task after a privilege violation, but the
 * problem that caused the privilege violation may be uncorrectable.
 *
 * @par                 Exception Error Code
 * Yes (special format). The processor provides the page-fault handler with two
 * items of information to aid in diagnosing the exception and recovering from
 * it:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>
 *         An error code on the stack. The error code for a page fault has a
 *         format different from that for other exceptions (refer to Figure
 *         5-7).
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         The contents of the CR2 register. The processor loads the CR2
 *         register with the 32-bit linear address that generated the
 *         exception. The page-fault handler can use this address to locate
 *         the corresponding page directory and page-table entries. If another
 *         page fault can potentially occur during execution of the page-fault
 *         handler, the handler must push the contents of the CR2 register onto
 *         the stack before the second page fault occurs.
 *     </LI>
 * </UL>
 * If a page fault is caused by a page-level protection violation, the access
 * flag in the page-directory entry is set when the fault occurs. The behavior
 * of Intel Architecture processors regarding the access flag in the
 * corresponding page-table entry is model specific and not architecturally
 * defined.
 *
 * @par                 Saved Instruction Pointer
 * The saved contents of CS and EIP registers generally point to the
 * instruction that generated the exception. If the page-fault exception
 * occurred during a task switch, the CS and EIP registers may point to the
 * first instruction of the new task (as described in the following “Program
 * State Change” section).
 * @par                 Program State Change
 * A program-state change does not normally accompany a page-fault exception,
 * because the instruction that causes the exception to be generated is not
 * executed. After the page-fault exception handler has corrected the violation
 * (for example, loaded the missing page into memory), execution of the program
 * or task can be resumed.<BR>
 * When a page-fault exception is generated during a task switch, the
 * program-state may change, as follows. During a task switch, a page-fault
 * exception can occur during any of following operations:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>
 *         While writing the state of the original task into the TSS of that
 *         task.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         While reading the GDT to locate the TSS descriptor of the new task.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         While reading the TSS of the new task.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         While reading segment descriptors associated with segment selectors
 *         from the new task.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         While reading the LDT of the new task to verify the segment
 *         registers stored in the new TSS.
 *     </LI>
 * </UL>
 * In the last two cases the exception occurs in the context of the new task.
 * The instruction pointer refers to the first instruction of the new task, not
 * to the instruction which caused the task switch (or the last instruction to
 * be executed, in the case of an interrupt). If the design of the operating
 * system permits page faults to occur during task-switches, the page-fault
 * handler should be called through a task gate.<BR>
 * If a page fault occurs during a task switch, the processor will load all the
 * state information from the new TSS (without performing any additional limit,
 * present, or type checks) before it generates the exception. The page-fault
 * handler should thus not rely on being able to use the segment selectors
 * found in the CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing another
 * exception. (Refer to the Program State Change description for “Interrupt
 * 10—Invalid TSS Exception (#TS)” for additional information on how to handle
 * this situation.)
 *
 * @par                 Additional Exception-Handling Information
 * Special care should be taken to ensure that an exception that occurs during
 * an explicit stack switch does not cause the processor to use an invalid
 * stack pointer (SS:ESP). Software written for 16-bit Intel Architecture
 * processors often use a pair of instructions to change to a new stack, for
 * example:
 * @code
 *     MOV SS, AX
 *     MOV SP, StackTop
 * @endcode
 * When executing this code on one of the 32-bit Intel Architecture processors,
 * it is possible to get a page fault, general-protection fault (#GP), or
 * alignment check fault (#AC) after the segment selector has been loaded into
 * the SS register but before the ESP register has been loaded. At this point,
 * the two parts of the stack pointer (SS and ESP) are inconsistent. The new
 * stack segment is being used with the old stack pointer.<BR>
 * The processor does not use the inconsistent stack pointer if the exception
 * handler switches to a well defined stack (that is, the handler is a task or
 * a more privileged procedure). However, if the exception handler is called at
 * the same privilege level and from the same task, the processor will attempt
 * to use the inconsistent stack pointer.<BR>
 * In systems that handle page-fault, general-protection, or alignment check
 * exceptions within the faulting task (with trap or interrupt gates), software
 * executing at the same privilege level as the exception handler should
 * initialize a new stack by using the LSS instruction rather than a pair of
 * MOV instructions, as described earlier in this note. When the exception
 * handler is running at privilege level 0 (the normal case), the problem is
 * limited to procedures or tasks that run at privilege level 0, typically the
 * kernel of the operating system.

 * @brief               <H3>Interrupt 16—Floating-Point Error Exception (#MF)</H3>
 *
 * @par                 Exception Class
 * Fault.
 *
 * @par                 Description
 * Indicates that the FPU has detected a floating-point-error exception. The NE
 * flag in the register CR0 must be set and the appropriate exception must be
 * unmasked (clear mask bit in the control register) for an interrupt 16,
 * floating-point-error exception to be generated. (Refer to Section 2.5.,
 * “Control Registers” in Chapter 2, System Architecture Overview for a
 * detailed description of the NE flag.)<BR>
 * While executing floating-point instructions, the FPU detects and reports six
 * types of floatingpoint errors:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>
 *         Invalid operation (#I)
 *         <UL>
 *             <LI> Stack overflow or underflow (#IS) </LI>
 *             <LI> Invalid arithmetic operation (#IA) </LI>
 *         </UL>
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI> Divide-by-zero (#Z) </LI>
 *     <LI> Denormalized operand (#D) </LI>
 *     <LI> Numeric overflow (#O) </LI>
 *     <LI> Numeric underflow (#U) </LI>
 *     <LI> Inexact result (precision) (#P) </LI>
 * </UL>
 * For each of these error types, the FPU provides a flag in the FPU status
 * register and a mask bit in the FPU control register. If the FPU detects a
 * floating-point error and the mask bit for the error is set, the FPU handles
 * the error automatically by generating a predefined (default) response and
 * continuing program execution. The default responses have been designed to
 * provide a reasonable result for most floating-point applications.<BR>
 * If the mask for the error is clear and the NE flag in register CR0 is set,
 * the FPU does the following:
 * <OL>
 *     <LI>
 *         Sets the necessary flag in the FPU status register.
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         Waits until the next “waiting” floating-point instruction or
 *         WAIT/FWAIT instruction is encountered in the program’s instruction
 *         stream. (The FPU checks for pending floatingpoint exceptions on
 *         “waiting” instructions prior to executing them. All the
 *         floating-point instructions except the FNINIT, FNCLEX, FNSTSW,
 *         FNSTSW AX, FNSTCW, FNSTENV, and FNSAVE instructions are “waiting”
 *         instructions.)
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         Generates an internal error signal that causes the processor to
 *         generate a floating-pointerror exception.
 *     </LI>
 * </OL>
 * All of the floating-point-error conditions can be recovered from. The
 * floating-point-error exception handler can determine the error condition
 * that caused the exception from the settings of the flags in the FPU status
 * word. Refer to “Software Exception Handling” in Chapter 7 of the Intel
 * Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information on
 * handling floating-point-error exceptions.
 *
 * @par                 Exception Error Code
 * None. The FPU provides its own error information.
 *
 * @par                 Saved Instruction Pointer
 * The saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the floating-point or
 * WAIT/FWAIT instruction that was about to be executed when the
 * floating-point-error exception was generated. This is not the faulting
 * instruction in which the error condition was detected. The address of the
 * faulting instruction is contained in the FPU instruction pointer register.
 * Refer to “The FPU Instruction and Operand (Data) Pointers” in Chapter 7 of
 * the Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more
 * information about information the FPU saves for use in handling
 * floating-point-error exceptions.
 *
 * @par                 Program State Change
 * A program-state change generally accompanies a floating-point-error
 * exception because the handling of the exception is delayed until the next
 * waiting floating-point or WAIT/FWAIT instruction following the faulting
 * instruction. The FPU, however, saves sufficient information about the error
 * condition to allow recovery from the error and re-execution of the faulting
 * instruction if needed.<BR>
 * In situations where nonfloating-point instructions depend on the results of
 * a floating-point instruction, a WAIT or FWAIT instruction can be inserted in
 * front of a dependent instruction to force a pending floating-point-error
 * exception to be handled before the dependent instruction is executed. Refer
 * to “Floating-Point Exception Synchronization” in Chapter 7 of the Intel
 * Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information
 * about synchronization of floating-point-error exceptions.

 * Bus errors detected by external agents are signaled to the processor on
 * dedicated pins: the BINIT# pin on the P6 family processors and the BUSCHK#
 * pin on the Pentium® processor. When one of these pins is enabled, asserting

 * a machine-check exception causes the processor to enter the shutdown state.

/**
 * @brief               <H3>Interrupt 19—SIMD Floating-Point Exception (#XF)</H3>
 *
 * @par                 Exception Class
 * Fault.
 *
 * @par                 Description
 * Indicates the processor has detected a SIMD floating-point execution unit
 * exception. The appropriate status flag in the MXCSR register must be set and
 * the particular exception unmasked for this interrupt to be generated.<BR>
 * There are six classes of numeric exception conditions that can occur while
 * executing Streaming SIMD Extensions:
 * <OL>
 *     <LI> Invalid operation (#I) </LI>
 *     <LI> Divide-by-zero (#Z) </LI>
 *     <LI> Denormalized operand (#D) </LI>
 *     <LI> Numeric overflow (#O) </LI>
 *     <LI> Numeric underflow (#U) </LI>
 *     <LI> Inexact result (Precision) (#P) </LI>
 * </OL>
 * Invalid, Divide-by-zero, and Denormal exceptions are pre-computation
 * exceptions, i.e., they are detected before any arithmetic operation occurs.
 * Underflow, Overflow, and Precision exceptions are post-computational
 * exceptions.<BR>
 * When numeric exceptions occur, a processor supporting Streaming SIMD
 * Extensions takes one of two possible courses of action:
 * <UL>
 *     <LI>
 *         The processor can handle the exception by itself, producing the most
 *         reasonable result and allowing numeric program execution to continue
 *         undisturbed (i.e., masked exception response).
 *     </LI>
 *     <LI>
 *         A software exception handler can be invoked to handle the exception
 *         (i.e., unmasked exception response).
 *     </LI>
 * </UL>
 * Each of the six exception conditions described above has corresponding flag
 * and mask bits in the MXCSR. If an exception is masked (the corresponding
 * mask bit in MXCSR = 1), the processor takes an appropriate default action
 * and continues with the computation. If the exception is unmasked (mask bit =
 * 0) and the OS supports SIMD floating-point exceptions (i.e. CR4.OSXMMEXCPT =
 * 1), a software exception handler is invoked immediately through SIMD
 * floating-point exception interrupt vector 19. If the exception is unmasked
 * (mask bit = 0) and the OS does not support SIMD floating-point exceptions
 * (i.e. CR4.OSXMMEXCPT = 0), an invalid opcode exception is signaled instead
 * of a SIMD floating-point exception.<BR> 
 * Note that because SIMD floating-point exceptions are precise and occur
 * immediately, the situation does not arise where an x87-FP instruction, an
 * FWAIT instruction, or another Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction will
 * catch a pending unmasked SIMD floating-point exception.
 *
 * @par                 Exception Error Code
 * None. The Streaming SIMD Extensions provide their own error information.
 *
 * @par                 Saved Instruction Pointer
 * The saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the Streaming SIMD
 * Extensions instruction that was executed when the SIMD floating-point
 * exception was generated. This is the faulting instruction in which the error
 * condition was detected.
 *
 * @par                 Program State Change
 * A program-state change generally accompanies a SIMD floating-point exception
 * because the handling of the exception is immediate unless the particular
 * exception is masked. The Pentium® III processor contains sufficient
 * information about the error condition to allow recovery from the error and
 * re-execution of the faulting instruction if needed.<BR>
 * In situations where a SIMD floating-point exception occurred while the SIMD
 * floating-point exceptions were masked, SIMD floating-point exceptions were
 * then unmasked, and a Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction was executed,
 * then no exception is raised.
