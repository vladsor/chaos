======

All CPU generic code are to be put here. Please, be very aware that
the code here *must* run on different endian-size systems, so be
careful with what you put here.

(Right now, far too much is put in the ia32 subdirectory. If you would
be interested of moving things here, please do so, and send us a
patch. Thanks.)
