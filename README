This is chaos, a free (licensed under the BSD license without
advertisment clause) operating system. It implements advanced features
such as virtual memory, interrupt/exception management, memory
protection, I/O protection, preemptive multitasking, ELF support, and
much, much more. It is a work in progress, and thus some parts might
be unfinished. If you are a programmer and would like to help us,
please contact us and we can see what you can help us with. Our
contact information can be found on the web page --

The following programs are required to compile:

* gcc (http://gcc.gnu.org, 3.0 or better is *required*)
* GNU CONS. (http://www.gnu.org/software/cons)
* GNU binutils.

Please consult README.Linux for some (possibly outdated) help about
building the system under your specific system. If you're running
anything else, you're totally on yourself.

chaos is known to run correctly on the following computers (at some
time):

* No-name Pentium 133 MHz (32 MiB RAM)

If you successfully compile/run it on another platform, with or
without patches, please tell us! Any experiences are welcome. Check
