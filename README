This is chaos, a free (GPL:ed, some parts LGPL:ed) operating
system. It implements advanced features such as virtual memory,
interrupt/exception management, memory protection, I/O protection,
preemptive multitasking, ELF support, and much, much more. It is a
work in progress, and thus some parts might be unfinished. If you are
a programmer and would like to help us, please contact us and we can
see what you can help us with. Our contact information can be found on
the web page -- http://www.chaosdev.org/

The following programs are required to compile:

* gcc (2.95 is *required*)
* GNU make. BSD make will *not* work.
* GNU binutils (fairly new. 2.9.5 tested)
* Perl. If you change the autochaos scripts, you will need to have some
  additional modules. They can all be found on CPAN.

Please consult README.Linux or README.FreeBSD for some (possibly
outdated) help about building the system under your specific
system. If you're running anything else, you're totally on yourself.

chaos is known to run correctly on the following computers (at some
time):

* AMD 386 SX-16, 8 meg RAM.
* 486 DX-2/66, 8 meg RAM.
* 486 DX/4-100, 16 meg RAM.
* P133, 20 meg RAM.
* P133, 64 meg ram.
* P233 w/ MMX, 64 meg RAM.
* K6-2/300, 128 meg RAM.
* K6-2/450, 128 meg RAM.
* Compaq Presario 5670 (P2, 450 MHz, 128 meg RAM)
* Toshiba 550 (P266MMX, 90 meg RAM)
* Compaq ProSignia 3080 (486DX, 33 MHz, 8 meg RAM)
* IBM Aptiva 330 (P75, 40 meg RAM)

If you successfully compile/run it on another platform, with or
without patches, please tell us! Any experiences are welcome. Check
