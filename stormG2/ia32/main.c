/* Abstract: This is the startup point of storm. It is executed right
   after the assembly language init code has set up the GDT, kernel
   stack, etc. Here, we initialise everything in the storm, like
   IRQ/exception handling, the timer hardware, the memory facilities
   of the host CPU and multitasking. It is also responsible for
   starting the servers loaded by the Multiboot compliant boot
   loader. */
