<abstract>
This is the chaos Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. In here, we try to
document the filsystem hierarchy used by the chaos Operating
System. See the <ref id="prologue" name="Prologue"> section for more
information about this.

<sect>Prologue<label id="prologue">
<p>
This file contains the FHS for the chaos operating system. It should
be noted that this is <em/not/ the only way to structure things in a
chaos system, but it is the preferred and programs that want to call
themselves 'Designed for chaos' must obey to these standards. More
specifically, a program that meets our criterias must also have no
hard-coded paths at all; all references to those directories must use
our defined paths, which are defined in the include file 'chaos.h' in
the standard chaos library. (More about this in the chaos Programming
Reference Manual)
</p>

<p>
This standard does not try to be like everything else. The regular way
of doing things does not necessarily have to be the best. In many
cases, you'll see this in that we have chosen a totally different
approach than everything else. Remember that chaos is not just another
boring UNIX clone; this is something totally different. Something <em/new/.

<descrip>
<tag>Directory /config</>

This is where all the configuration files are stored. It does not
contain any files, only directories. System configuration files are
stored in /config/chaos. A program designed for chaos should put its
system wide configuration files in '/config/PROGRAM', where PROGRAM is
the name of the program. (I.e., if program foo wants to store
configuration about bar, it should create the directory '/config/foo'
and put the information in '/config/foo/bar') General preferences for
a program should be put in a file called "preferences" in the
program's configuration directory. As a general rule, never put the
program's name in the name of the configuration file.

<tag>Directory /config/chaos</>

This is where all the system configuration files are stored. An
example of such a file is 'config/chaos/servers' that contains a list
of all the servers that should be started at boot time. (Servers
started from the Multiboot bootloader (usually GRUB) does not have to
be listed in this file)

<tag>Directory /libraries</>

This is where all libraries (only shared; static are placed elsewhere)
are stored. A library should generally have the name '&lt;name&gt;-x.y.z',
so the foo library of version 1.2.3 would be called
'foo-1.2.3'. (There's no need to indicate in the filename that this is
a library since it is implicated by the path name)

<tag>Directory /modules</>

Here, loadable modules used by some programs and libraries will be
found (in appropriate subdirectories, of course). This is used to
support, for example, data types (the ability for a program to
read/write to data formats without knowing how they are stored).

<tag>Directory /clients</>

This is where all the binaries of the programs you have installed. For
example, the binary for the program 'cluido' is located at
'/clients/cluido/cluido'.

<tag>Directory /system</>

This is where operating system files are stored (except for
configuration files). There should be no files in this directory; only
subdirectories.

<tag>Directory /system/servers</>

Here, all the servers installed are stored. They are usually
compressed with GNU zip. Most servers doesn't have a configuration
file, so the binary is just about it. (except for the documentation)

<tag>Directory /system/kernel</>

This is where the kernel image should be stored.  A normal gzipped
storm kernel image is called /system/kernel/storm-xx.yy.zz.gz, for
example.

<tag>Directory /data</>

Here, the programs store can store arbitrary data. For example, the
program "Quake" could store its data in the directory
'/data/quake'. Another example is '/data/programming/c/headers', where
C header files is stored. (Yes, we know this is very different from
what most of you are used to. This is on purpose. A non-programmer
shouldn't need to have any header files installed.)

<tag>Directory /temp</>

This is where temporary files should be stored, for example
information that a program doesn't need for the moment. This directory
is cleared at system startup.

<tag>Directory /users</>

Here, the users' home directories are stored. The home directory for
user "foo" is located at '/users/foo'.

<sect>Virtual Directories

<descrip>
<tag>Directory /devices</>

When a server is launched, it can create an entry in this directory
if, and only if, it serves a block or character device. This entry can
then be used for accessing the device the server manages (for example,
the server 'keyboard' creates the entry '/devices/keyboard' here,
where it will put an entry for each keyboard found. Thus,
'/devices/keyboard/0' can be used to access the first keyboard, and so
on.

<tag>Directory /services</>

Servers that don't do hardware but more abstract things may want to
create entries here. For example, the IP server might create
'/services/network/protocol/ipv4'. This virtual file can then be
IOCTL:d (TODO: how should this work?) to get the PID of this process,
so that a program that wants to do IP knows which PID to send the
message to

<tag>Directory /kernelfs</>

This is the kernel virtual file system. In here, you can find some
information about the status of the system; for example, process
information (CPU usage, memory load, etc).
