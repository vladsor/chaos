Physical Memory Map
===================

Offset | Length | Description
-------+--------+--------------------
     0 |     4K | GDT/IDT
    4K |     4K | storm TSS
    8K |     8K | storm stack
   16K |     4K | Module names and parameters
    1M |      ? | Kernel start

Also, at 1.5 MB, the data structures for physical page allocation is
located. It consists of a list and a bitmap. Don't think about how
this works. This is the way the chaos operating system does it, and it
works.
