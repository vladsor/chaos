stored in /config/chaos. A program designed for chaos should put its
system wide configuration files in '/config/PROGRAM', where PROGRAM is
the name of the program. (I.e., if program foo wants to store
configuration about bar, it should create the directory '/config/foo'
and put the information in '/config/foo/bar') General preferences for
a program should be put in a file called "preferences" in the
program's configuration directory. As a general rule, never put the
program's name in the name of the configuration file.\endSeq{}\endNode{}\Node%
