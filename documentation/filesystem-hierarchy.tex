themselves 'Designed for chaos' must obey to these standards. More
specifically, a program that meets our criterias must also have no

our defined paths, which are defined in the include file 'chaos.h' in
the standard chaos library. (More about this in the chaos Programming

contain any files, only directories. System configuration files are
stored in /config/chaos. A program designed for chaos should put its
system wide configuration files in '/config/PROGRAM', where PROGRAM is
the name of the program. (I.e., if program foo wants to store
configuration about bar, it should create the directory '/config/foo'
and put the information in '/config/foo/bar') General preferences for
a program should be put in a file called "preferences" in the
program's configuration directory. As a general rule, never put the
