Introduction

   chaos is, as you probably know, an operating system written totally
   from scratch by a bunch of Swedish (and others) hackers. Right now, we
   have not come as far as to write an installation program, so getting
   chaos onto your computer is not as straightforward as it could be. In
   this paper, you will be able to get some information about the
   different methods of setting things up. Hopefully, after reading this,
   you will find setting chaos up pretty trivial. In any way, please do
   not hesitate to mail staff@chaosdev.org if this information is wrong
   in any way.
   
   Now, as you will see, there are several methods of trying out chaos.
   They have one chapter each, and are listed in order of complexity.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 1. Installing a floppy image

   Using a floppy image to try out chaos is very easy. All you have to do
   is download the floppy image (from our download page on
   http://www.chaosdev.org, or via anonymous FTP to
   ftp://ftp.chaosdev.org/chaos). Now, gunzip it if your web browser did
   not do it auto-magically (Netscape Navigator does that, and possible
   others too). If you do not have a program for decompressing gz files,
   get one from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gzip.
   
   When you have decompressed the floppy image, get it onto a 1.44 3,5"
   floppy. If you are using DOS or Windows, get the rawrite2.exe program
   from ftp://ftp.chaosdev.org/dosutils. Write like this:
      rawrite2 -f floppy.img -d a:


   (Give the floppy image a letter within the 8.3 range to avoid
   problems; rawrite is a DOS program with no support for long file
   names)
   
   If you are using some kind of Unix (most probably Linux or some of the
   BSD:s. Anything else is probably out of the scope of this document,
   and if you are using such a system, you should be skilled enough to do
   such things anyway), do like this:
      dd if=floppy.image of=/dev/fd0


   And that is all! Now, boot a computer with this floppy, and something
   magic will (hopefully) appear. Much joy!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Chapter 2. Compiling the source

   Do you feel tired of waiting for us to update the floppy images, or do
   you feel to do some chaos hacking? If so, compiling the source is
   probably of interest. It is really not very difficult. First, get the
   sources, and decompress them. Do something like this:
      tar xvIf chaos_snapshot-20001224.tar.bz2


   (You must have a pretty recent tar and a working bzip2 for this to
   work. If you are using and older version of tar, you might have to
   decompress the file manually first)
   
   Now, go to the newly created chaos directory, and read the file
   README.Linux. It will contain up-to-date instructions for building the
   system.
   
   If everything works out fine, your chaos root (/mnt/chaos is the only
   possible choice right now -- sorry about that) will be filled with
   new, fresh stuff. It is not really more difficult than this.

Appendix A. Net-booting

   The absolutely most elegant way to boot chaos, especially when
   developing the system, is to use the net-boot feature of GNU GRUB, our
   boot loader. It is a little tricky to get up, so we provide some
   information for your pleasure.
   
   This chapter will tell you how to get GNU GRUB with net-boot installed
   on a floppy, but you should be able to do the same if you want to
   install GNU GRUB on your hard drive. The reason we are primarily
   focusing on doing a floppy is because it is easier, and it will make
   most people happy. In the future, it is very likely that we will
   extend this chapter to include this information.
   
   First, you must choose which method you want to use to configure the
   IP address of the system you want to net-boot on (hereafter referred
   to as the client). This is used to select which software to install on
   the machine you want to boot from (hereafter called the server). The
   methods available in GNU GRUB right now are rarpd, bootp and DHCP.
   They all work pretty similarly, so if you are unsure of which one to
   choose, just pick anyone. If you happen to be on a network where a
   DHCP or bootp server already exists, you can be a little tricky and
   install a rarpd server, without risk of interfering with the other
   server. (You can find all the software you need for this at
   http://www.freshmeat.net/)
   
   When you have got the IP configuration server up and running, it is
   time to install a TFTP server. TFTP is an acronym for Trivial File
   Transfer Protocol and is used by GNU GRUB to transfer the kernel and
   servers from the boot server. You can find TFTP servers at the same
   place as the rest of the software.
   
   (I will not go into detail about how to configure the software here,
   but I will just mention one thing I would like you to avoid: GNU GRUB
   does not support "IP ranges" in the DHCP server configuration. You
   must have a host entry for the machine in question).
   
   Okay, so you might have succeeded in getting rarpd/bootpd/dhcpd and
   tftpd installed, but where do we go from there? This is where it
   starts getting interesting. Unpack the GNU GRUB source, change to the
   newly created directory and write like this:
      ./configure --help | less


   Now, make sure your network adapter is supported by GRUB. If it is,
   run configure again, with the correct parameter. For example, like
   this:
      ./configure --enable-rtl8139


   Now, run the 'make', which will compile the GRUB stage1 and stage2
   files. For information about how to install the created files, check
   the GNU GRUB documentation. Basically, format the floppy (FAT or ext2
   is just fine) and copy the stage1 and stage2 files there. Now, run the
   GRUB shell and write something like this:
      install (fd0)/stage1 (fd0) (fd0)/stage2 (fd0)/menu


   Now, create a file on the floppy, called menu. It should look like
   this:
      timeout = 1
      title = Netboot
      dhcp
      configfile (nd)/mnt/chaos/config/grub/menu


   Substitute dhcp with bootp or rarp if you like. Now, boot with this
   floppy, and it will (hopefully) configure its IP address and load the
   second configuration file from the server.

Appendix B. Example GNU GRUB menu file

   This is what I use on my net-boot server:
timeout = 2

title Net-chaos
root (nd)
kernel /mnt/chaos/system/kernel/storm
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/keyboard
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/vga
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/console
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/log
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/cluido
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/cluido
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/cluido
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/cluido
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/initial_ramdisk
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/fat
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/virtual_file_system
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/pci
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/serial
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/boot
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/tornado


   This is what I use when booting chaos locally:
title chaos

kernel /mnt/chaos/system/kernel/storm
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/keyboard
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/console
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/vga
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/cluido
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/log
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/idle
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/fat
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/initial_ramdisk
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/virtual_file_system
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/ipv4
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/3c509
module /mnt/chaos/system/servers/boot
