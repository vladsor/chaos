  * Implement support for writing files in the FAT and VFS servers.
  * Extend autochaos and merge with cAPS, so package building can be
    done.
  * Finish the ISO/POSIX libraries, for easy start-up porting of GNU
    applications.
  * Port Perl to chaos, so autochaos can be run natively.  
  * Create tornado.
