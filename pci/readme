When the PCI server is launched, it notifies that all devices in the
system are new (since it hasn't used them before). It saves a list of
all devices, and write this list to disk. It also stores all new
devices in a list (the first time, those lists will be identical, but
any other time, the new-list will only contain new devices that has
been installed into the system).

When the boot server has initialised stuff properly (mounted the
ramdisk, etc), it sends a special message to the PCI server, to get
the list of new devices (The list contains only the vendor and device
IDs). It then checks in the database over PCI IDs and servers to know
which server to start (if it is installed). Whenever a server package
that provides hardware support for some PCI device is installed in the
system, cAPS adds its list of supported devices to this list if it is
not already there.
