============

chaos has been successfully compiled on the following distributions:

* Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato).
* Debian GNU/Linux 2.x (woody).
* Red Hat 6.2 (Cartman) (with updated binutils).
* Slackware 7.0 (with updated binutils).

It will NOT work on Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 for the same reason Red Hat
and slackware needs to be patched: binutils need to be fairly
recent. Of course, upgrading a Debian system is much easier than
almost anything else, so this should not be much of a problem.
