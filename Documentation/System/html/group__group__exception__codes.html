<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>The nonmaskable interrupt (NMI) is generated externally by asserting the processor’s NMI pin or through an NMI request set by the I/O APIC to the local APIC on the APIC serial bus. This interrupt causes the NMI interrupt handler to be called.</dd></dl>

<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>The instruction executing when an NMI interrupt is received is completed before the NMI is generated.

<h3>Interrupt 3—Breakpoint Exception (#BP)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Trap.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that a breakpoint instruction (INT 3) was executed, causing a breakpoint trap to be generated. Typically, a debugger sets a breakpoint by replacing the first opcode byte of an instruction with the opcode for the INT 3 instruction. (The INT 3 instruction is one byte long, which makes it easy to replace an opcode in a code segment in RAM with the breakpoint opcode.) The operating system or a debugging tool can use a data segment mapped to the same physical address space as the code segment to place an INT 3 instruction in places where it is desired to call the debugger. With the P6 family, Pentium®, Intel486™, and Intel386™ processors, it is more convenient to set breakpoints with the debug registers. (Refer to Section 15.3.2., “Breakpoint Exception (#BP)—Interrupt Vector 3”, in Chapter 15, <em>Debugging and Performance Monitoring</em>, for information about the breakpoint exception.) If more breakpoints are needed beyond what the debug registers allow, the INT 3 instruction can be used. The breakpoint (#BP) exception can also be generated by executing the INT n instruction with an operand of 3. The action of this instruction (INT 3) is slightly different than that of the INT 3 instruction (refer to “INTn/INTO/INT3—Call to Interrupt Procedure” in Chapter 3 of the Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2).</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>None.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>Saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the instruction following the INT 3 instruction.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>Even though the EIP points to the instruction following the breakpoint instruction, the state of the program is essentially unchanged because the INT 3 instruction does not affect any register or memory locations. The debugger can thus resume the suspended program by replacing the INT 3 instruction that caused the breakpoint with the original opcode and decrementing the saved contents of the EIP register. Upon returning from the debugger, program execution resumes with the replaced instruction. </dd></dl>

<h3>Interrupt 4—Overflow Exception (#OF)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Trap.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that an overflow trap occurred when an INTO instruction was executed. The INTO instruction checks the state of the OF flag in the EFLAGS register. If the OF flag is set, an overflow trap is generated. Some arithmetic instructions (such as the ADD and SUB) perform both signed and unsigned arithmetic. These instructions set the OF and CF flags in the EFLAGS register to indicate signed overflow and unsigned overflow, respectively. When performing arithmetic on signed operands, the OF flag can be tested directly or the INTO instruction can be used. The benefit of using the INTO instruction is that if the overflow exception is detected, an exception handler can be called automatically to handle the overflow condition.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>None.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>The saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the instruction following the INTO instruction.</dd></dl>

(Refer to Section 5.4., “Program or Task Restart” for general rules for taking of interrupts and exceptions.)<br>
 The opcodes D6 and F1 are undefined opcodes that are reserved by Intel. These opcodes, even though undefined, do not generate an invalid opcode exception.<br>

<h3>Interrupt 7—Device Not Available Exception (#NM)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Fault.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates one of the following things: The device-not-available fault is generated by either of three conditions: <ul>
<li>
The processor executed a floating-point instruction while the EM flag of register CR0 was set.  </li>
<li>
The processor executed a floating-point, MMX™ or SIMD floating-point (excluding prefetch, sfence or streaming store instructions) instruction while the TS flag of register CR0 was set.  </li>
<li>
The processor executed a WAIT or FWAIT instruction while the MP and TS flags of register CR0 were set.  </li>
</ul>
The EM flag is set when the processor does not have an internal floating-point unit. An exception is then generated each time a floating-point instruction is encountered, allowing an exception handler to call floating-point instruction emulation routines.<br>
 The TS flag indicates that a context switch (task switch) has occurred since the last time a floating-point, MMX™ or SIMD floating-point (excluding prefetch, sfence or streaming store instructions) instruction was executed, but that the context of the FPU was not saved. When the TS flag is set, the processor generates a device-not-available exception each time a floating-point, MMX™ or SIMD floating-point (excluding prefetch, sfence or streaming store instructions) instruction is encountered. The exception handler can then save the context of the FPU before it executes the instruction. Refer to Section 2.5., “Control Registers”, in Chapter 2, System Architecture Overview, for more information about the TS flag.<br>
 The MP flag in control register CR0 is used along with the TS flag to determine if WAIT or FWAIT instructions should generate a device-not-available exception. It extends the function of the TS flag to the WAIT and FWAIT instructions, giving the exception handler an opportunity to save the context of the FPU before the WAIT or FWAIT instruction is executed. The MP flag is provided primarily for use with the Intel286 and Intel386™ DX processors. For programs running on the P6 family, Pentium®, or Intel486™ DX processors, or the Intel 487 SX coprocessors, the MP flag should always be set; for programs running on the Intel486™ SX processor, the MP flag should be clear.</dd></dl>

<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>A program-state change does not accompany a device-not-available fault, because the instruction that generated the exception is not executed.<br>
 If the EM flag is set, the exception handler can then read the floating-point instruction pointed to by the EIP and call the appropriate emulation routine.<br>
 If the MP and TS flags are set or the TS flag alone is set, the exception handler can save the context of the FPU, clear the TS flag, and continue execution at the interrupted floating-point or WAIT/FWAIT instruction. </dd></dl>

<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class </b></dt><dd>Abort.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that the processor detected a second exception while calling an exception handler for a prior exception. Normally, when the processor detects another exception while trying to call an exception handler, the two exceptions can be handled serially. If, however, the processor cannot handle them serially, it signals the double-fault exception. To determine when two faults need to be signaled as a double fault, the processor divides the exceptions into three classes: benign exceptions, contributory exceptions, and page faults (refer to Table 5-4). <table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">

Table 5-5 shows the various combinations of exception classes that cause a double fault to be generated. A double-fault exception falls in the abort class of exceptions. The program or task cannot be restarted or resumed. The double-fault handler can be used to collect diagnostic information about the state of the machine and/or, when possible, to shut the application and/or system down gracefully or restart the system.<br>
 A segment or page fault may be encountered while prefetching instructions; however, this behavior is outside the domain of Table 5-5. Any further faults generated while the processor is attempting to transfer control to the appropriate fault handler could still lead to a double-fault sequence. <table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">

If another exception occurs while attempting to call the double-fault handler, the processor enters shutdown mode. This mode is similar to the state following execution of an HLT instruction. In this mode, the processor stops executing instructions until an NMI interrupt, SMI interrupt, hardware reset, or INIT# is received. The processor generates a special bus cycle to indicate that it has entered shutdown mode. Software designers may need to be aware of the response of hardware to receiving this signal. For example, hardware may turn on an indicator light on the front panel, generate an NMI interrupt to record diagnostic information, invoke reset initialization, generate an INIT initialization, or generate an SMI.<br>
 If the shutdown occurs while the processor is executing an NMI interrupt handler, then only a hardware reset can restart the processor.</dd></dl>

This exception can generated either in the context of the original task or in the context of the new task (refer to Section 6.3., “Task Switching” in Chapter 6, Task Management). Until the processor has completely verified the presence of the new TSS, the exception is generated in the context of the original task. Once the existence of the new TSS is verified, the task switch is considered complete. Any invalid-TSS conditions detected after this point are handled in the context of the new task. (A task switch is considered complete when the task register is loaded with the segment selector for the new TSS and, if the switch is due to a procedure call or interrupt, the previous task link field of the new TSS references the old TSS.)<br>
 To insure that a valid TSS is available to process the exception, the invalid-TSS exception handler must be a task called using a task gate.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>An error code containing the segment selector index for the segment descriptor that caused the violation is pushed onto the stack of the exception handler. If the EXT flag is set, it indicates that the exception was caused by an event external to the currently running program (for example, if an external interrupt handler using a task gate attempted a task switch to an invalid TSS).</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>If the exception condition was detected before the task switch was carried out, the saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the instruction that invoked the task switch. If the exception condition was detected after the task switch was carried out, the saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the first instruction of the new task.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>The ability of the invalid-TSS handler to recover from the fault depends on the error condition than causes the fault. Refer to Section 6.3., “Task Switching” in Chapter 6, Task Management for more information on the task switch process and the possible recovery actions that can be taken.<br>
 If an invalid TSS exception occurs during a task switch, it can occur before or after the commit-to-new-task point. If it occurs before the commit point, no program state change occurs. If it occurs after the commit point (when the segment descriptor information for the new segment selectors have been loaded in the segment registers), the processor will load all the state information from the new TSS before it generates the exception. During a task switch, the processor first loads all the segment registers with segment selectors from the TSS, then checks their contents for validity. If an invalid TSS exception is discovered, the remaining segment registers are loaded but not checked for validity and therefore may not be usable for referencing memory. The invalid TSS handler should not rely on being able to use the segment selectors found in the CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing another exception. The exception handler should load all segment registers before trying to resume the new task; otherwise, general-protection exceptions (#GP) may result later under conditions that make diagnosis more difficult. The Intel recommended way of dealing situation is to use a task for the invalid TSS exception handler. The task switch back to the interrupted task from the invalid-TSS exceptionhandler task will then cause the processor to check the registers as it loads them from the TSS. </dd></dl>

<h3>Interrupt 11—Segment Not Present (#NP)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Fault.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that the present flag of a segment or gate descriptor is clear. The processor can generate this exception during any of the following operations: <ul>
<li>
While attempting to load CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS registers. [Detection of a not-present segment while loading the SS register causes a stack fault exception (#SS) to be generated.] This situation can occur while performing a task switch.  </li>
<li>
While attempting to load the LDTR using an LLDT instruction. Detection of a not-present LDT while loading the LDTR during a task switch operation causes an invalid-TSS exception (#TS) to be generated.  </li>
<li>
When executing the LTR instruction and the TSS is marked not present. While attempting to use a gate descriptor or TSS that is marked segment-not-present, but is otherwise valid.  </li>
</ul>
An operating system typically uses the segment-not-present exception to implement virtual memory at the segment level. If the exception handler loads the segment and returns, the interrupted program or task resumes execution.<br>
 A not-present indication in a gate descriptor, however, does not indicate that a segment is not present (because gates do not correspond to segments). The operating system may use the present flag for gate descriptors to trigger exceptions of special significance to the operating system.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>An error code containing the segment selector index for the segment descriptor that caused the violation is pushed onto the stack of the exception handler. If the EXT flag is set, it indicates that the exception resulted from an external event (NMI or INTR) that caused an interrupt, which subsequently referenced a not-present segment. The IDT flag is set if the error code refers to an IDT entry (e.g., an INT instruction referencing a not-present gate).</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>The saved contents of CS and EIP registers normally point to the instruction that generated the exception. If the exception occurred while loading segment descriptors for the segment selectors in a new TSS, the CS and EIP registers point to the first instruction in the new task. If the exception occurred while accessing a gate descriptor, the CS and EIP registers point to the instruction that invoked the access (for example a CALL instruction that references a call gate).</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>If the segment-not-present exception occurs as the result of loading a register (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS, or LDTR), a program-state change does accompany the exception, because the register is not loaded. Recovery from this exception is possible by simply loading the missing segment into memory and setting the present flag in the segment descriptor.<br>
 If the segment-not-present exception occurs while accessing a gate descriptor, a program-state change does not accompany the exception. Recovery from this exception is possible merely by setting the present flag in the gate descriptor.<br>
 If a segment-not-present exception occurs during a task switch, it can occur before or after the commit-to-new-task point (refer to Section 6.3., “Task Switching” in Chapter 6, Task Management). If it occurs before the commit point, no program state change occurs. If it occurs after the commit point, the processor will load all the state information from the new TSS (without performing any additional limit, present, or type checks) before it generates the exception. The segment-not-present exception handler should thus not rely on being able to use the segment selectors found in the CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing another exception. (Refer to the Program State Change description for “Interrupt 10—Invalid TSS Exception (#TS)” in this chapter for additional information on how to handle this situation.) </dd></dl>

<h3>Interrupt 12—Stack Fault Exception (#SS)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Fault.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that one of the following stack related conditions was detected: <ul>
<li>
A limit violation is detected during an operation that refers to the SS register. Operations that can cause a limit violation include stack-oriented instructions such as POP, PUSH, CALL, RET, IRET, ENTER, and LEAVE, as well as other memory references which implicitly or explicitly use the SS register (for example, MOV AX, [BP+6] or MOV AX, SS:[EAX+6]). The ENTER instruction generates this exception when there is not enough stack space for allocating local variables.  </li>
<li>
A not-present stack segment is detected when attempting to load the SS register. This violation can occur during the execution of a task switch, a CALL instruction to a different privilege level, a return to a different privilege level, an LSS instruction, or a MOV or POP instruction to the SS register.  </li>
</ul>
Recovery from this fault is possible by either extending the limit of the stack segment (in the case of a limit violation) or loading the missing stack segment into memory (in the case of a not-present violation.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>If the exception is caused by a not-present stack segment or by overflow of the new stack during an inter-privilege-level call, the error code contains a segment selector for the segment that caused the exception.

For a normal limit violation (on a stack segment already in use) the error code is set to 0.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>The saved contents of CS and EIP registers generally point to the instruction that generated the exception.

<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>A program-state change does not generally accompany a stack-fault exception, because the instruction that generated the fault is not executed. Here, the instruction can be restarted after the exception handler has corrected the stack fault condition.<br>
 If a stack fault occurs during a task switch, it occurs after the commit-to-new-task point (refer to Section 6.3., “Task Switching” Chapter 6, Task Management). Here, the processor loads all the state information from the new TSS (without performing any additional limit, present, or type checks) before it generates the exception. The stack fault handler should thus not rely on being able to use the segment selectors found in the CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing another exception. The exception handler should check all segment registers before trying to resume the new task; otherwise, general protection faults may result later under conditions that are more difficult to diagnose. (Refer to the Program State Change description for “Interrupt 10—Invalid TSS Exception (#TS)” for additional information on how to handle this situation.) </dd></dl>

<h3>Interrupt 14—Page-Fault Exception (#PF)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Fault.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that, with paging enabled (the PG flag in the CR0 register is set), the processor detected one of the following conditions while using the page-translation mechanism to translate a linear address to a physical address: <ul>
<li>
The P (present) flag in a page-directory or page-table entry needed for the address translation is clear, indicating that a page table or the page containing the operand is not present in physical memory.  </li>
<li>
The procedure does not have sufficient privilege to access the indicated page (that is, a procedure running in user mode attempts to access a supervisor-mode page).  </li>
<li>
Code running in user mode attempts to write to a read-only page. In the Intel486™ and later processors, if the WP flag is set in CR0, the page fault will also be triggered by code running in supervisor mode that tries to write to a read-only user-mode page.  </li>
</ul>
The exception handler can recover from page-not-present conditions and restart the program or task without any loss of program continuity. It can also restart the program or task after a privilege violation, but the problem that caused the privilege violation may be uncorrectable.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>Yes (special format). The processor provides the page-fault handler with two items of information to aid in diagnosing the exception and recovering from it: <ul>
<li>
An error code on the stack. The error code for a page fault has a format different from that for other exceptions (refer to Figure 5-7).  </li>
<li>
The contents of the CR2 register. The processor loads the CR2 register with the 32-bit linear address that generated the exception. The page-fault handler can use this address to locate the corresponding page directory and page-table entries. If another page fault can potentially occur during execution of the page-fault handler, the handler must push the contents of the CR2 register onto the stack before the second page fault occurs.  </li>
</ul>
If a page fault is caused by a page-level protection violation, the access flag in the page-directory entry is set when the fault occurs. The behavior of Intel Architecture processors regarding the access flag in the corresponding page-table entry is model specific and not architecturally defined.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>The saved contents of CS and EIP registers generally point to the instruction that generated the exception. If the page-fault exception occurred during a task switch, the CS and EIP registers may point to the first instruction of the new task (as described in the following “Program State Change” section). </dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>A program-state change does not normally accompany a page-fault exception, because the instruction that causes the exception to be generated is not executed. After the page-fault exception handler has corrected the violation (for example, loaded the missing page into memory), execution of the program or task can be resumed.<br>
 When a page-fault exception is generated during a task switch, the program-state may change, as follows. During a task switch, a page-fault exception can occur during any of following operations: <ul>
<li>
While writing the state of the original task into the TSS of that task.  </li>
<li>
While reading the GDT to locate the TSS descriptor of the new task.  </li>
<li>
While reading the TSS of the new task.  </li>
<li>
While reading segment descriptors associated with segment selectors from the new task.  </li>
<li>
While reading the LDT of the new task to verify the segment registers stored in the new TSS.  </li>
</ul>
In the last two cases the exception occurs in the context of the new task. The instruction pointer refers to the first instruction of the new task, not to the instruction which caused the task switch (or the last instruction to be executed, in the case of an interrupt). If the design of the operating system permits page faults to occur during task-switches, the page-fault handler should be called through a task gate.<br>
 If a page fault occurs during a task switch, the processor will load all the state information from the new TSS (without performing any additional limit, present, or type checks) before it generates the exception. The page-fault handler should thus not rely on being able to use the segment selectors found in the CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing another exception. (Refer to the Program State Change description for “Interrupt 10—Invalid TSS Exception (#TS)” for additional information on how to handle this situation.)</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Additional Exception-Handling Information</b></dt><dd>Special care should be taken to ensure that an exception that occurs during an explicit stack switch does not cause the processor to use an invalid stack pointer (SS:ESP). Software written for 16-bit Intel Architecture processors often use a pair of instructions to change to a new stack, for example: <pre><div class="fragment">     MOV SS, AX
     MOV SP, StackTop
</div></pre>When executing this code on one of the 32-bit Intel Architecture processors, it is possible to get a page fault, general-protection fault (#GP), or alignment check fault (#AC) after the segment selector has been loaded into the SS register but before the ESP register has been loaded. At this point, the two parts of the stack pointer (SS and ESP) are inconsistent. The new stack segment is being used with the old stack pointer.<br>
 The processor does not use the inconsistent stack pointer if the exception handler switches to a well defined stack (that is, the handler is a task or a more privileged procedure). However, if the exception handler is called at the same privilege level and from the same task, the processor will attempt to use the inconsistent stack pointer.<br>
 In systems that handle page-fault, general-protection, or alignment check exceptions within the faulting task (with trap or interrupt gates), software executing at the same privilege level as the exception handler should initialize a new stack by using the LSS instruction rather than a pair of MOV instructions, as described earlier in this note. When the exception handler is running at privilege level 0 (the normal case), the problem is limited to procedures or tasks that run at privilege level 0, typically the kernel of the operating system. </dd></dl>

<h3>Interrupt 16—Floating-Point Error Exception (#MF)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Fault.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that the FPU has detected a floating-point-error exception. The NE flag in the register CR0 must be set and the appropriate exception must be unmasked (clear mask bit in the control register) for an interrupt 16, floating-point-error exception to be generated. (Refer to Section 2.5., “Control Registers” in Chapter 2, System Architecture Overview for a detailed description of the NE flag.)<br>
 While executing floating-point instructions, the FPU detects and reports six types of floatingpoint errors: <ul>
<li>
Invalid operation (#I) <ul>
<li>
Stack overflow or underflow (#IS)  </li>
<li>
Invalid arithmetic operation (#IA)  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Divide-by-zero (#Z)  </li>
<li>
Denormalized operand (#D)  </li>
<li>
Numeric overflow (#O)  </li>
<li>
Numeric underflow (#U)  </li>
<li>
Inexact result (precision) (#P)  </li>
</ul>
For each of these error types, the FPU provides a flag in the FPU status register and a mask bit in the FPU control register. If the FPU detects a floating-point error and the mask bit for the error is set, the FPU handles the error automatically by generating a predefined (default) response and continuing program execution. The default responses have been designed to provide a reasonable result for most floating-point applications.<br>
 If the mask for the error is clear and the NE flag in register CR0 is set, the FPU does the following: <ol>
<li>
Sets the necessary flag in the FPU status register.  </li>
<li>
Waits until the next “waiting” floating-point instruction or WAIT/FWAIT instruction is encountered in the program’s instruction stream. (The FPU checks for pending floatingpoint exceptions on “waiting” instructions prior to executing them. All the floating-point instructions except the FNINIT, FNCLEX, FNSTSW, FNSTSW AX, FNSTCW, FNSTENV, and FNSAVE instructions are “waiting” instructions.)  </li>
<li>
Generates an internal error signal that causes the processor to generate a floating-pointerror exception.  </li>
</ol>
All of the floating-point-error conditions can be recovered from. The floating-point-error exception handler can determine the error condition that caused the exception from the settings of the flags in the FPU status word. Refer to “Software Exception Handling” in Chapter 7 of the Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information on handling floating-point-error exceptions.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>None. The FPU provides its own error information.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>The saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the floating-point or WAIT/FWAIT instruction that was about to be executed when the floating-point-error exception was generated. This is not the faulting instruction in which the error condition was detected. The address of the faulting instruction is contained in the FPU instruction pointer register. Refer to “The FPU Instruction and Operand (Data) Pointers” in Chapter 7 of the Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information about information the FPU saves for use in handling floating-point-error exceptions.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>A program-state change generally accompanies a floating-point-error exception because the handling of the exception is delayed until the next waiting floating-point or WAIT/FWAIT instruction following the faulting instruction. The FPU, however, saves sufficient information about the error condition to allow recovery from the error and re-execution of the faulting instruction if needed.<br>
 In situations where nonfloating-point instructions depend on the results of a floating-point instruction, a WAIT or FWAIT instruction can be inserted in front of a dependent instruction to force a pending floating-point-error exception to be handled before the dependent instruction is executed. Refer to “Floating-Point Exception Synchronization” in Chapter 7 of the Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information about synchronization of floating-point-error exceptions. </dd></dl>

<small> 1. 128-bit datatype introduced with the Pentium ® III processor. This type of alignment check is done for operands less than 128-bits in size: 32-bit scalar single and 16-bit/32-bit/64-bit integer MMX™ technology; 2, 4, or 8 byte alignments checks are possible when #AC is enabled. Some exceptional cases are: <ul>
<li>
The MOVUPS instruction, which performs a 128-bit unaligned load or store. In this case, 2/4/8-byte misalignments will be detected, but detection of 16-byte misalignment is not guaranteed and may vary with implementation.  </li>
<li>
The FXSAVE/FXRSTOR instructions - refer to instruction descriptions  </li>
</ul>
</small> To enable alignment checking, the following conditions must be true: <ul>
<li>
AM flag in CR0 register is set.  </li>
<li>
AC flag in the EFLAGS register is set.  </li>
<li>
The CPL is 3 (protected mode or virtual-8086 mode).  </li>
</ul>
Alignment-check faults are generated only when operating at privilege level 3 (user mode). Memory references that default to privilege level 0, such as segment descriptor loads, do not generate alignment-check faults, even when caused by a memory reference made from privilege level 3.<br>
 Storing the contents of the GDTR, IDTR, LDTR, or task register in memory while at privilege level 3 can generate an alignment-check fault. Although application programs do not normally store these registers, the fault can be avoided by aligning the information stored on an even word-address.<br>
 FSAVE and FRSTOR instructions generate unaligned references which can cause alignmentcheck faults. These instructions are rarely needed by application programs.</dd></dl>

<h3>Interrupt 18—Machine-Check Exception (#MC)</h3>

<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Class</b></dt><dd>Abort.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Description</b></dt><dd>Indicates that the processor detected an internal machine error or a bus error, or that an external agent detected a bus error. The machine-check exception is model-specific, available only on the P6 family and Pentium® processors. The implementation of the machine-check exception is different between the P6 family and Pentium® processors, and these implementations may not be compatible with future Intel Architecture processors. (Use the CPUID instruction to determine whether this feature is present.)<br>
 Bus errors detected by external agents are signaled to the processor on dedicated pins: the BINIT# pin on the P6 family processors and the BUSCHK# pin on the Pentium® processor. When one of these pins is enabled, asserting the pin causes error information to be loaded into machine-check registers and a machine-check exception is generated.<br>
 The machine-check exception and machine-check architecture are discussed in detail in Chapter 13, Machine-Check Architecture. Also, refer to the data books for the individual processors for processor-specific hardware information.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>None. Error information is provide by machine-check MSRs.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>For the P6 family processors, if the EIPV flag in the MCG_STATUS MSR is set, the saved contents of CS and EIP registers are directly associated with the error that caused the machinecheck exception to be generated; if the flag is clear, the saved instruction pointer may not be associated with the error (refer to Section 13.3.1.2., “MCG_STATUS MSR”, in Chapter 13, Machine-Check Architecture).<br>
 For the Pentium® processor, contents of the CS and EIP registers may not be associated with the error.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>A program-state change always accompanies a machine-check exception.

Invalid, Divide-by-zero, and Denormal exceptions are pre-computation exceptions, i.e., they are detected before any arithmetic operation occurs. Underflow, Overflow, and Precision exceptions are post-computational exceptions.<br>
 When numeric exceptions occur, a processor supporting Streaming SIMD Extensions takes one of two possible courses of action: <ul>
<li>
The processor can handle the exception by itself, producing the most reasonable result and allowing numeric program execution to continue undisturbed (i.e., masked exception response).  </li>
<li>
A software exception handler can be invoked to handle the exception (i.e., unmasked exception response).  </li>
</ul>
Each of the six exception conditions described above has corresponding flag and mask bits in the MXCSR. If an exception is masked (the corresponding mask bit in MXCSR = 1), the processor takes an appropriate default action and continues with the computation. If the exception is unmasked (mask bit = 0) and the OS supports SIMD floating-point exceptions (i.e. CR4.OSXMMEXCPT = 1), a software exception handler is invoked immediately through SIMD floating-point exception interrupt vector 19. If the exception is unmasked (mask bit = 0) and the OS does not support SIMD floating-point exceptions (i.e. CR4.OSXMMEXCPT = 0), an invalid opcode exception is signaled instead of a SIMD floating-point exception.<br>
 Note that because SIMD floating-point exceptions are precise and occur immediately, the situation does not arise where an x87-FP instruction, an FWAIT instruction, or another Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction will catch a pending unmasked SIMD floating-point exception.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Exception Error Code</b></dt><dd>None. The Streaming SIMD Extensions provide their own error information.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Saved Instruction Pointer</b></dt><dd>The saved contents of CS and EIP registers point to the Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction that was executed when the SIMD floating-point exception was generated. This is the faulting instruction in which the error condition was detected.</dd></dl>
<dl compact><dt><b>Program State Change</b></dt><dd>A program-state change generally accompanies a SIMD floating-point exception because the handling of the exception is immediate unless the particular exception is masked. The Pentium® III processor contains sufficient information about the error condition to allow recovery from the error and re-execution of the faulting instruction if needed.<br>
 In situations where a SIMD floating-point exception occurred while the SIMD floating-point exceptions were masked, SIMD floating-point exceptions were then unmasked, and a Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction was executed, then no exception is raised. </dd></dl>
