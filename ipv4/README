This is the IPv4 server for chaos. It's currently pretty limited
(depends on a DHCP server for parameter configuration, doesn't support
routing, etc), but works okay anyway. If you think you've found a bug,
please send mail (preferrable with a patch that fixes the problem) to
the mail adress given below. Thanks.
