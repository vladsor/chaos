	* route.h: New file.

	* forward.h: Likewise.

	* forward.c: Likewise.

	* route.c: Likewise.

	* ipv4.c (interface_get_number): New function.
	(interface_get_amount): Likewise.
	(interface_get): Likewise.
	(interface_add): Likewise.

2000-08-05  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* tcp.h (tcp_header_type): Cleaned up the names.

	* ipv4.c (ipv4_checksum): Fixed a cruicial bug which made the
	routine calculate bad checksums for stuff with an odd length.

	* ipv4.h (ipv4_header_type): Cleaned up the names.

2000-08-04  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* dhcp.c (dhcp_assign): Added code for setting
	message_parameter.protocol, since it was missing.

	* dhcp.h (dhcp_message_type): Cleaned up the names.

2000-07-24  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* All C files: Converted from using raw system calls to using
	ipc_send (), ipc_receive () and other nice, friendly functions.
 
2000-07-21  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Started rewriting some parts of the server, so that it can
	support multiple interfaces. Ideally, it would grab all ethernet
	devices and do DHCP (or static address assignment) for them, but
	right now it just uses the first one (if available) and also
	creates a loopback device.

	* Converted to the new kernel.
