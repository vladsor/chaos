NOTE! This is an unstable prerelease of chaos. Do expect system crashes and
strange behaviour. There is no need for you, as a user, to fix minor bugs and
send us patches, since the bug probably already have been fixed when the patch
arrives to us. If you find a serious bug though, please report to
chaos-devel@lists.chaosdev.org and hopefully we can work something out. Thank
you for your time and interest in the project.\n");

This is cluido, the Command Line User Interface. Type 'help' or '?' for
information about available commands. You can also cycle through the virtual
consoles using ALT+TAB. To 'bind' a console to a function key, use
CTRL+ALT+Fn. This console can later be switched to by pressing ALT+Fn.
Consoles having a blue background are shells, just like this one, and consoles
with a black background is the log consoles (one for servers and one for the
kernel). If tornado has been started, it will have its own graphical console
with a movable mouse cursor.

Some Emacs compatible bindings (C-a, C-e, etc) are available, and also some
DOS:ish ones (Home, End, arrows). You can go back and forth in the command
history with the up and down arrows.\n\n");
