=======

To build chaos just type ./build in this directory after having unpacked the
snapshot or checked the source out from CVS. The built kernels, libraries,
servers and programs will be created in a chaos filesystem located under
./root. To change this (build directly to a mounted chaos partition or alike),
edit the build script and change the line CHAOS_INSTALL_PATH=... Then run
./build again.

If you would like to recreate your configure scripts using the autochaos
utility, you will need the XML-Simple module from
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/. I think it depends on XML-Parser
available from the same directory. These are Perl modules, so you will of
course need Perl as well.

Questions, bug reports and general feedback go to staff@chaosdev.org or the
appropriate mailing list. Please check out http://www.chaosdev.org/ if you
feel unsure about anything.
